OBJECTIVE:
With the attached prompt, or Linear issue, create a feature requirement document in the `docs/features` folder based on the `docs/templates/feature-requirement.md` template. Name the file with date and feature name like this: `YY-MM-DD_feature-name`
For example: `25-08-25_job-application-form`

Ask follow-up questions when you are unsure of what is the best approach or if key information is missing. 

Focus on what Claude Sonnet 4 needs to implement the feature with a great outcome. 

The output document must be in valid Markdown format and nothing else.
